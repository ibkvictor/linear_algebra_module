# linear_algebra_module

Introduction: The project constructs a vector using Object Oriented Design using python classes. The vector object holds attributes similar to vectors and possess the ability to perform familar linear algebra operations. These operations include computation of its magnitude, dot product (scalar product), cross product (vector product), vector angle, unit vector, vector addition and subraction, and so on.

* def add(self, v):
vector addition operator for adding vectors that are conform to each other.

* def subtract(self, v):
vector addition operator for subracting two vectors that are conform to each other.

*  def scalar_multiply(self, s):
scalar_multiply performs multiplication of a scalar (value) and a vector. The returned value is a vector scaled by the value of the scalar quantity.

*  def dot(self, v):
The dot operator performs a scalar multiplication of two vectors using linear algebraic principles. The resulting value is a scalar sum of the unit values of each axis in both vectors multiplied.

* def angle(self, v):
This operation computes the orientation of a vector relative to the linear algrebraic conventional .

* def magnitude(self):
Vectorial magnitude is a linear algebraic concept to relate vectors to scalars by value. The operator produces the magnitude of vector object.

* def unit_vector(self):
A unit vector represents an unscaled form of a vector. The operation divides axis values by its scalar magnitude to obtain the unit vector.
            
* def cross(self, v):
The cross operator performs a vector multiplication of two vectors using linear algebraic principles. The resulting value is a vector representing a unique conforming individual sum of adjacent axis.
